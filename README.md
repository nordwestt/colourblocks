Colours text in pastel colours for better readability

## Description
Reading through long paragraphs, it can be nice to glance away while you let the information get absorbed and digested by your brain. With ColourBlocks, the paragraphs are coloured in oh-so-pleasing pastel colours, allowing you to easily keep track of where you were on a page.
Pro-tip; use Ctrl + Shift + Y to activate/deactivate.
